## üìñ Usage

Here's a quick example to show how easy it is to start using PixelForge:

```csharp
using PixelForge.Core;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Drawing.Imaging;

// Load an image
var image = Image.FromFile("path/to/image.png");

// Rotate image by 90 degrees
var rotatedImage = ImageProcessor.RotateImage(image, 90);

// Save the processed image
rotatedImage.Save("path/to/rotated_image.png", ImageFormat.Png);
```

> **Note**: Additional examples and API documentation will be added soon!
